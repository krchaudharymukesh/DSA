# Why should I learn Data Structure and Algorithm.
    Because:
__Algorithms:__

        * let’s start with an example, there is some problem in mathematics, generally a problem can be solved in many ways but the best answer is the problem which we can solve less time and short method 
        * Similarly in algorithms,sort the below input 21,34,1,2,4,5 this is the input for your algorithm, everybody writes an algorithm but best algorithm is which takes less time complexity and space complexity
        * For the above example the sorting method we use is “quicksort” quicksort is best for small inputs and for the bigger inputs merge sort is best 
        * Means based on the input we decide which algorithm we used 
        * They are many programmers in the world but the best programmer is who writes the code with less time and space complexity
        * For that reason we learn algorithms

__Data structures:__

        * Data structures are important to organize the data
        * Whenever we talk about an algorithm, algorithm is nothing but trying to solve a problem, that problem should take some input and then problem should create some output 
        * The input and output should be given in some format that format is called data structure.
        * Depending on the format in which we give the input to the program the algorithm time complexity will be vary
        * For example, trying to search an element in array is the problem, so if the input array is sorted then time complexity will be less
        * If the input array is unsorted then time complexity will be more

_So data structures and algorithms plays very crucial role for programmers_
